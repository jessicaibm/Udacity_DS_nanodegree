### Project Motivation

> "For this project, you will pick a dataset. Inspired by Robert, there are a few public datasets from Airbnb available below, but you may also choose a dataset similar to what was used in the lessons, or an entirely different dataset. Using your dataset, you will choose 3 questions you aspire to answer from the data."

I chose Airbnb data in Seattle, and have the following three questions:

- Are there any buzz words in listing names that are associated with more bookings?

- What neighborhood is most profitable?

- What are the most influential features on individual listing profit?

### Data

The data about Airbnb in Seattle can be downloaded from **Kaggle**:
